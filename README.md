These are Arch Linux PKGBUILDs for ZFS on Linux (ZoL) based on the Git master branch. They are based on the wonderful work done by [@demizer](https://github.com/demizer) at [demizer/archzfs](https://github.com/demizer/archzfs). The PKGBUILDs are here for information purposes and are **not** supposed to be used on production systems unless you really know what you are doing.
