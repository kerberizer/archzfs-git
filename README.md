These are Arch Linux PKGBUILDs for ZFS on Linux (ZoL) based on the Git master branch. They are based on the wonderful work done by [@demizer](https://github.com/demizer) at [demizer/archzfs](https://github.com/demizer/archzfs). The PKGBUILDs are here for information purposes and are **not** supposed to be used on production systems unless you really know what you are doing. For those both adventurous and lazy (huh?), ready built packages are available from [this repo](http://kerberia.net/archlinux/repo/archzfs-git).

**Important notice:** For the ZFS datasets to be mounted and shared properly, it's imperative to enable `zfs.target` in systemd. Any old `zfs.service` should be disabled accordingly.
